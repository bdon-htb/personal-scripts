# personal-scripts
A compilation of scripts I have written in python. Contains scripts I have used for automating digital activities and algorithm studies.

The prefix 'myc' stands for 'my command'. I run those scripts straight from the GNU/Linux terminal (emulator) without cding to its directory.
So I include the prefix to differentiate it from actual linux bash commands.
